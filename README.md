# Marine Life
## DDU themed pilot project
Currently, we are working on a project, 
that raises awareness about ocean life. 
Did you know that about 71% of the earth's surface is covered in water, 
and that we have only explored 5% of it? 

As we know, 
fish live in the ocean across the globe. 
With the perfect water temperature and pH value of water, 
fish and coral reefs and easily thrive. 

But that is unfortunately not the case. Due to global warming, <br> 
underwater life face new challenges: High temperature, rising water levels, <br>
occurrences of strong storms and strong acids in the ocean etc.

### Ocean Acidifcation
Due to the excess amounts of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere, <br>
our oceans are becoming more acidic. This is due to the CO2 reacting <br>
with our ocean water. By doing so it's lowering the pH-value of the oceanwater <br>
hindering creatures that require Calcium Carbonate to build their shells and bones.

### Rising Sea Temperatures
Due to the excess heat caused by global warmings, that of which 91% is absorved by our ocean, have constantly warmed since the 1970's. <br> <br>
Warmer water alters organismsâ€™ metabolisms. For example, warmer water can increase oxygen demand. It can cause mobile species to move and change their distribution range, leading to changes in food webs and ecosystem dynamics, as seen for many fish species (EEA, 2022b). <br> <br>

### Ocean Deoxygenation
Due to rising sea temperatures, another factor joins in on the top.
<br><br> Ocean deoxygenation, as the name suggests, is the loss of oxygen in sea water. 
<br><br>It occurs as warmer waters hold less dissolved oxygen. This occurs alongside increased oxygen consumption by various organisms and increased stratification and changes in ventilation (IPCC, 2019).
