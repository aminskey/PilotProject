# Marine Life
## DDU themed pilot project
Currently, we are working on a project, 
that raises awareness about ocean life. 
Did you know that about 71% of the earth's surface is covered in water, 
and that we have only explored 5% of it? 

As we know, 
fish live in the ocean across the globe. 
With the perfect water temperature and pH value of water, 
fish and coral reefs and easily thrive. 

But that is unfortunately not the case. Due to global warming, <br> 
underwater life face new challenges: High temperature, rising water levels, <br>
occurrences of strong storms and strong acids in the ocean etc. But another underrated killer is Marine plastic. <br>

Marine plastic is responsible for degrading habitat and killing marine and coastal wildlife.
Deaths caused by suffocation, indigestion, starvation and entanglement etc. About 1,500 species in marine and terrestial environments are known to ingenst plastics (US EPA, 2024).

### How it affects us
Plastic debris is polluting the human food chain as well. Most of the fish that we eat have small microplastics in them, that we consume daily (or as often as we eat fish). In 2008 (yes a long time ago), Algalita researchers began finding that fish are ingesting plastic fragments and debris. Of the 672 fish caught during that voyage, 35% had ingested plastic pieces (Clean Water Action, 2024).

### The Assignment
You have been contacted by the United Nations, whom have hired you to develop a software product. Now the UN aren't experts in software development and have therefore contacted you to make a software product that advertises the UN and creates awareness about one or more of their 17 sustainability goals.
<br> <br>
The United Nations have the intention to brand themselves while creating awareness about their worldly goals.
